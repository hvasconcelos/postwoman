## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

- Use Swift's standard naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types)
- Prefer `let` over `var` where possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and concise

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Use `@State` for view-local state
- Use `@Bindable` for SwiftData models in views
- Extract reusable components into separate views
- Use `.task` or `.onAppear` for async work

### SwiftData Guidelines

- Define clear relationships with appropriate delete rules
- Use `@Query` for fetching data in views
- Handle optional relationships gracefully
